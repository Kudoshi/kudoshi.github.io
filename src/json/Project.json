            "A thief simulator game where the goal of the game is to steal items based on level's objective in a house while avoid being detected. There are CCTV and guards which can expose you. When you run or get exposed, you increase the detection meter which when filled, the player will lose the game. When the player steals the item, their movement speed will decrease based on the weight of the item. Therefore, the player needs to be smart in what to steal and when to unload the stolen items in their car.",
